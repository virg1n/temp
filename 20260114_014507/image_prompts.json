A wide, ominous establishing shot of 16th-century Strasbourg, July 1518. Narrow cobblestone streets and dark half-timbered buildings under a heavy, dramatic sky. The scene is quiet, hinting at impending doom. Anthropomorphic catfolk figures in period clothing are sparsely visible. Serious mood, no text or UI elements.",

Focus on a single female anthropomorphic catfolk (Frau Troffea) standing isolated in the center of a cobblestone square. She is dressed in simple 16th-century attire and has just begun an unnatural, jerky dance movement. Her expression is already strained. Harsh, dramatic sunlight casts sharp shadows. Serious, dramatic mood, no text or UI elements.",
