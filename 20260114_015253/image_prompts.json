Two large sailing ships are visible in heavy rain and mountainous waves. In the foreground, a catfolk sailor (wearing 1870s oilskins) stands on the deck of the 'Dei Gratia', urgently pointing toward a distant, mysterious brigantine ('Mary Celeste') battling the waves. Dark, ominous sky. No text or UI elements.",

Heavy rain streaks across the screen (parallax particles). A catfolk sailor in the foreground blinks and breathes (micro-animation), his oilskin coat and tail flap slightly in the strong wind (micro-animation). The distant brigantine subtly pitches and rolls in the massive, foam-flecked waves (heroic movement). Dynamic lightning flashes briefly on the horizon (dynamic light). Loopable, cinematic atmosphere.
