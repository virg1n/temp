Full-body shot of a stern, powerful Catfolk Tsar (Peter the Great analogue) in historically accurate 18th-century Russian military uniform. He stands triumphantly in a dimly lit throne room. At his feet is a disturbing pile of dark, severed catfolk beards and hair, stylized with visible pixels. Limited color palette. Cinematic lighting, deep shadows. No text or UI.",
      "video_prompt": "A seamlessly looping 16-bit pixel art scene. Soft, slow upward vertical pan (tilt-up) revealing the imposing Catfolk Tsar. Dynamic flickering candlelight casting moving shadows on the pile of severed beards in the foreground (2.5D parallax). Micro-animations: Tsar breathing deeply, his tail slightly twitching, uniform fabric gently swaying. Atmospheric particle animation: fine dust motes slowly rising near the light sources. Hero movement: The Tsar slowly and deliberately taps his boot heel once every loop on the marble floor."
