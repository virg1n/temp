A close-up portrait of an exhausted, elderly female catfolk (cat-person) survivor, bruised but alive, dressed in modest 1901-era attire. She looks weary but intensely determined. A dented, heavy oak barrel is visible behind her on the riverbank. Dramatic, serious mood.",
      "video_prompt": "Cinematic 16-bit pixel art, seamless loop. Close-up on the elderly female catfolk survivor (cat-person) near a rocky riverbank. She is visibly breathing heavily (micro-animation). Her ears twitch slightly. Water droplets are constantly dripping from her wet clothes and hair (particles). Slow, subtle zoom-in (dolly) combined with a gentle handheld shake. The background parallax shows the turbulent river water flowing past."

Cinematic, awe-inspiring mood.",

The heavy oak barrel is rapidly carried by the turbulent, rushing river current toward the edge of the falls (heroic action loop: barrel moving continuously through water).

Spray and white foam constantly churn around the barrel (particles). The scene implies increasing speed and roaring water."
