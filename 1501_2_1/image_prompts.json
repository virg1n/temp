Camera: Slow, subtle dolly zoom outward, emphasizing the distance between the character and the celestial threat (2.5D parallax). Movement: The catfolk slowly raises one hand toward the window in a contemplative gesture, then slowly lowers it (looping action). His tail sways gently. The comet's tail glows and pulses slightly.
