Subtle micro handheld camera sway. 2.5D parallax shift between the polished floor (FG), the King (MG), and the stone wall tapestry (BG). Soft light flickers from unseen torchlight, casting moving shadows. The King subtly adjusts his velvet cloak, his tail twitches slightly, and his chest rises and falls with breathing.
