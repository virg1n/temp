      "prompt": "Cinematic 16-bit pixel art, Retro SNES RPG style. Extreme wide shot emphasizing scale. A powerful Catfolk Khan, wearing full historical regalia, stands small against an impossibly vast, unbroken panoramic landscape that incorporates diverse biomes—snowy mountains, green steppes, arid deserts, and forests—all merging into one continuous domain. The scene visually represents the record-breaking size of the empire. Dramatic lighting, limited color palette, visible pixels. No text."
