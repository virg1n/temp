      "image_prompt": "A cinematic, wide shot (SNES RPG cutscene style) of a gigantic, imposing concrete fortress dominating the landscape under a dramatic, overcast sky. Catfolk construction workers (wearing early 20th-century uniforms/helmets) stand small against the scale of the massive walls, looking up with pride. Detailed retro 16-bit pixel art, limited color palette, cinematic composition, visible pixels.",
      "video_prompt": "Soft, slow vertical pan (tilt-up) revealing the sheer height of the fortification. Foreground: Catfolk engineers monitor construction, their tails slightly swaying, cloth gently rustling in the wind. Midground: The immense, textured concrete walls. Background: Heavy, dark clouds slowly drift across the sky (2.5D parallax). Subtle dynamic lighting emphasizing the size. Seamless loop, retro 16-bit pixel art."

      "image_prompt": "Close-up, dramatic shot showing catastrophic damage to a fortress wall. A massive, jagged hole is blown through four-meter-thick concrete, exposing twisted internal steel reinforcement rods. Thick smoke billows out. A defeated Catfolk defender (Belgian 1940s uniform) is slumped against the rubble in the foreground, helmet askew, looking despairing. Retro 16-bit pixel art, deep shadows, dramatic lighting, visible pixels.",
      "video_prompt": "Slow, deliberate dolly-in shot focused on the blown-out section of the fortress wall. Thick, dark smoke constantly pours out of the hole (looping particle effect). The defeated Catfolk soldier in the foreground breathes heavily, chest rising and falling, ears twitching slightly (micro-animation). Subtle flickering light source inside the breach suggests ongoing small fires. Seamless loop, retro 16-bit pixel art."

      "image_prompt": "A long shot across a green, European field towards the distant, massive silhouette of the fortress. In the foreground, a group of Catfolk soldiers (German uniforms, 1940 style) peer through binoculars or maps, preparing for the assault. The sky is early dawn, ominous and cold. Retro 16-bit pixel art, high contrast silhouette, limited palette.",
      "video_prompt": "Slow, subtle left-to-right parallax movement (dolly right). Foreground: Tall grass gently sways in the wind. Midground: The Catfolk soldiers observing the fortress; one lowers his binoculars slightly, then raises them again (looping action). Background: The fortress silhouette remains static. Low-lying morning mist slowly drifts across the field (particle effect). Seamless loop, retro 16-bit pixel art."
