A stern catfolk doctor (Semmelweis) in 19th-century surgical attire (dark coat, white apron) stands isolated and defiant in a long, tiled hospital corridor. He is illuminated by a single harsh, overhead gas lamp light. Two shadowy catfolk figures (senior doctors) stand in the background, arms crossed, looking down on him with intense disapproval. Limited color palette, visible pixels. No text, no letters, no numbers, no signage, no subtitles, no UI.",
      "video_prompt": "Looping 16-bit pixel art animation. Slow, soft camera push-in (dolly forward) on the defiant catfolk doctor (Semmelweis) standing in the harsh light of a hospital corridor. Dynamic flickering gaslight source casting moving shadows. Fine dust motes drift slowly in the light beam (particles). The doctor is breathing heavily, his tail twitches slightly with tension, and he performs a subtle, looping gesture of defiance, gripping the lapel of his coat firmly (heroic movement loop). The background doctors slightly shift their weight, their ears twitching in anger. Seamless loop. No text, no letters, no numbers, no signage, no subtitles, no UI."
